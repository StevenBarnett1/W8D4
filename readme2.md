In this exercise, determine an endpoint for each of the use cases. Don't worry
about getting it perfect as this is just practice! API endpoints use similar
routes to a traditional web server's RESTful routes. The major difference
between API endpoints those of a traditional web server is that API endpoints
can use all HTTP verbs (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).
For example, to edit a specific post, the API endpoint could be
`PATCH /posts/:postId`
- Get all the posts
- Create a new post
- Edit a post
- Create a new user
- Get the comments for a post
- Create a comment for a post
- Edit a comment for a post
- Delete a comment for a post

- Add a like for a post
- Remove a like for a post
- Get all the posts of a user
- Submit a search on posts
